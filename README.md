   - Controller: Register new users with details like email, first name, last name, mobile number, occupation, currency, country, city, etc.

2\. **User Authentication:**\
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/login`\
   - Middleware: Passport.js authentication\
   - Controller: Authenticate users and issue JWT tokens for session management.

3\. **Shift Input:**\
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/shifts`\
   - Model: `Shift`\
   - Middleware: JWT authentication\
   - Controller: Record shifts with start time, end time, date, and client details.

4\. **Invoice Generation:**\
